# Assignment 1
**Developers:** Fatih Agirtmis, Maria Handschu, and Ryan Amarsingh

**Note:** Our assignment was developed using Juypter Notebook. We decided to use this software based on the ability to code and write analysis clearly in the same document. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.

In this directory, we have four sub directories: 

1) `Control_Structures_In_Python:` This folder contains the code and analysis done on 2 control structures in Python (If statements and Boolean Expressions)

2) `Data_Structures_In_Python:` This doler contains the code and analysis done for 3 common datastructures (Stacks, Queues, Arrays) in Python

3) `Datasets:` This folder contains datasets we leveraged in this assignment.

4) `Input_Output_In_Python:` This folder contains input and output code with regard to Python
